Ansible role that installs WireGuard and management scripts for OpenWISP.
Once installed and configured correctly with
[OpenWISP](https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-controller/#how-to-setup-wireguard-tunnels),
WireGuard peers are managed automatically by OpenWISP without the need of
manual intervention.

This role can also configure scripts to allow OpenWISP manage
[VXLAN over WireGuard](https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-controller/#how-to-setup-vxlan-over-wireguard-tunnels) tunnels.

Tested on **Debian**, **Ubuntu** and **CentOS**.

**NOTE**: it is highly suggested to use this procedure on clean
virtual machines or linux containers.

**Minimum ansible version supported**: 2.10.

## Install & Usage Instructions

For the sake of simplicity, the easiest thing is to install this
role **on your local machine** via `ansible-galaxy`:

```
ansible-galaxy install openwisp.wireguard_openwisp
```

Refer to the example playbook in
["Full Example Playbook with SSL certificate" section of this documentation](#full-example-playbook-with-ssl-certificate)
to quickly get started with this role.

**NOTE:** This role **will not configure forwarding packets nor add static
or dynamic routes** on your server.

Since the exact way in which packets can be routed can vary depending on
different factors and needs which can differ greatly from organization to
organization, it's left out to the user to configure it according to their needs.
[We may add a default routing/forwarding configuration in the future once we have more usage data, if you're interested in this, please let us know](https://github.com/openwisp/ansible-wireguard-openwisp/issues/8).

### Full Example Playbook with SSL certificate

By default the playbook creates a self-signed (untrusted) SSL certificate for
the VPN endpoint. If you keep the untrusted certificate, you will also need to
disable SSL verification on OpenWISP, although we advice against using this
kind of setup in a production environment. You can
install your own trusted certificate by following steps in this section.

The first thing you have to do is to setup a valid domain for your wireguard
VPN, this means your inventory file (hosts) should look like the following:

```
[openwisp2_wireguard]
wireguard.yourdomain.com
```

You must be able to add a DNS record for `wireguard.yourdomain.com`, you cannot
use an ip address in place of `wireguard.yourdomain.com`.

Once your domain is set up and the DNS record is propagated, proceed by
installing the ansible role [geerlingguy.certbot](https://galaxy.ansible.com/geerlingguy/certbot/)

```
ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.certbot
```

Then proceed to create your playbook.yml so that it will look similar to the
following example:

```yaml
- hosts: openwisp2_wireguard
  become: "{{ become | default('yes') }}"
  roles:
    - geerlingguy.certbot
    - openwisp.wireguard_openwisp
  vars:
    openwisp2_wireguard_controller_url: "https://openwisp.yourdomain.com"
    openwisp2_wireguard_vpn_uuid: "paste-vpn-uuid-here"
    openwisp2_wireguard_vpn_key: "paste_vpn-key-here"
    openwisp2_wireguard_flask_key: "paste-endpoint-auth-token"

    # SSL certificates
    openwisp2_wireguard_ssl_cert: "/etc/letsencrypt/live/{{ ansible_fqdn }}/fullchain.pem"
    openwisp2_wireguard_ssl_key: "/etc/letsencrypt/live/{{ ansible_fqdn }}/privkey.pem"

    # certbot configuration
    certbot_auto_renew_user: "privileged-user-to-renew-certs"
    certbot_auto_renew_minute: "20"
    certbot_auto_renew_hour: "5"
    certbot_create_if_missing: true
    certbot_create_standalone_stop_services: []
    certbot_certs:
      - email: "paste-your-email"
        domains:
          - wireguard.yourdomain.com
```

Read the [documentation of `geerlingguy.certbot`](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-certbot#readme)
to learn more about configuration of certbot role.

### Setting up multiple WireGuard Interfaces

Using this role you can set up multiple WireGuard interfaces on the same
machine that are managed by OpenWISP independently. You will have to
ensure that the following role variables are unique for each playbook:

- `openwisp2_wireguard_path`
- `openwisp2_wireguard_flask_port`

Below is an example playbook containing two plays for setting up multiple
WireGuard interfaces.

```yaml
- name: Setup up first WireGuard interface
  hosts:
    - wireguard
  become: "{{ become | default('yes') }}"
  roles:
    - openwisp.wireguard_openwisp
  vars:
    openwisp2_wireguard_controller_url: "https://openwisp.yourdomain.com"
    openwisp2_wireguard_path: "/opt/wireguard-openwisp/wireguard-1"
    openwisp2_wireguard_vpn_uuid: "paste-vpn1-uuid-here"
    openwisp2_wireguard_vpn_key: "paste-vpn1-key-here"
    openwisp2_wireguard_flask_key: "paste-vpn1-endpoint-auth-token"
    openwisp2_wireguard_flask_port: 8081

- name: Setup second WireGuard interface
  hosts:
    - wireguard
  become: "{{ become | default('yes') }}"
  roles:
    - openwisp.wireguard_openwisp
  vars:
    openwisp2_wireguard_controller_url: "https://openwisp.yourdomain.com"
    openwisp2_wireguard_path: "/opt/wireguard-openwisp/wireguard-2"
    openwisp2_wireguard_vpn_uuid: "paste-vpn-2-uuid-here"
    openwisp2_wireguard_vpn_key: "paste-vpn-2-key-here"
    openwisp2_wireguard_flask_key: "paste-vpn-2-endpoint-auth-token"
    openwisp2_wireguard_flask_port: 8082
```

### Gotchas

- While creating VPN server objects in OpenWISP, ensure that `interface name`
  and `port` are unique for each VPN. Otherwise, the update scripts will
  not work properly due to conflicts.

## Role Variables

This role has many variables values that can be changed to best suit
your needs.

Below are listed all the variables you can customize
(you may also want to take a look at
[the default values of these variables](https://github.com/openwisp/ansible-wireguard-openwisp/blob/main/defaults/main.yml)).

```yaml
- hosts: openwisp2_wireguard
  become: "{{ become | default('yes') }}"
  roles:
    - openwisp.wireguard_openwisp
  vars:
    # URL of OpenWISP instance, you can omit this (delete it) if wireguard
    # is being installed on the same host on which OpenWISP is running.
    # If you're using two separate hosts (one for OpenWISP and one for Wireguard),
    # which is a good idea, you will need to specify the URL of your
    # OpenWISP instance (running OpenWISP Controller >= 1.0.0) here
    openwisp2_wireguard_controller_url: "https://openwisp.yourdomain.com"

    openwisp2_wireguard_ssl_cert: "/opt/wireguard-openwisp/ssl/server.crt"
    openwisp2_wireguard_ssl_key: "/opt/wireguard-openwisp/ssl/server.key"

    openwisp2_wireguard_python: python2.7
    # virtualenv command for your remote distribution, usually set automcatically
    openwisp2_wireguard_virtualenv_command: "virtualenv"

### How to run tests

If you want to contribute to `ansible-wireguard-openwisp` you should run tests
in your development environment to ensure your changes are not breaking anything.

To do that, proceed with the following steps:

**Step 1**: Clone `ansible-wireguard-openwisp`

Clone repository by:

```
git clone https://github.com/<your_fork>/ansible-wireguard-openwisp.git
```

**Step 2**: Install docker

If you haven't installed docker yet, you need to install it (example for linux debian/ubuntu systems):

```
sudo apt-get install docker.io
```

**Step 3**: Install molecule and dependencies

```
pip install molecule[docker,ansible] yamllint ansible-lint docker
```

**Step 4**: Download docker images

```
docker pull geerlingguy/docker-ubuntu2004-ansible:latest
docker pull geerlingguy/docker-ubuntu1804-ansible:latest
docker pull geerlingguy/docker-debian10-ansible:latest
docker pull geerlingguy/docker-centos7-ansible:latest
docker pull geerlingguy/docker-centos8-ansible:latest
```

**Step 5**: Run molecule test

```
molecule test -s local
```

If you don't get any error message it means that the tests ran successfully without errors.

**ProTip:** Use `molecule test -s local --destroy=never` to speed up subsequent test runs.
